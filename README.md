**Quick Note:**

I am uploading this because I am interested in doing front-end development. 
This is a protfolio piece but you are free to use the code if you wish.

## Purpose:

This clock is styled using only CSS and my goal with this project was to show basic HTML, CSS, and Javascript knowledge and interaction between all 3 languages.
